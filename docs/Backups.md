# Backups

## Postgres

We use https://app.snapshooter.com/ (recommended by Digial Ocean) to run our nightly database backup.

This is a full single backup of all databases with 14 days retention.

We store the backups in https://secure.backblaze.com/ (as it's cheeper than snapshooter's storage!)

Credentails for both are in metacpan credentials
